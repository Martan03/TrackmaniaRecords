# Trackmania Records

Me and my friends play Trackmania and we like to compete with each other.
So I desided to make website, so we can upload our records and share them with each other.

## Programming Language

I decided to code in PHP, because I know it better than JS and I also needed database connection.
I used MVC (Model View Controller), in my opinion, it's good way to code easy way. If I used some framework, it would be
bit of overkill for project this size (at least I though). But also it's better than putting everything in one file.  
I decided to make this website mutlilanguage as well, so I implemented English, German and Czech.


## Website overview

### Seasons

This is how the landing page looks, you can create new season and access already created seasons.  
(in next update I'll fix the order of seasons)

### Season page (levels)

If you open a season, you'll see all the levels with it's record holder and record time

You can than open each level and see record history. You can also click on player on this page and open player profile.

### Statistics

Last page on this website is Statistics. Currently there is just my statistic and that is number of records hold by each player.
I'd like to add more statistics though.
